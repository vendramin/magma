The idea of this Magma workshop is to hold an informal, friendly
seminar/workshop to explore the computer algebra system
[Magma](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). 

Everyone is welcome to contribute, whether with talks, questions, exercises,
solutions, or anything else you think might be useful.

## Wanna contribute?

Feel free to contact anyone in the [VUB algebra
group](https://leandrovendramin.org/team/) if you’d like to get involved!
