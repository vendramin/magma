To compute the direct product of two or more groups, Magma provides the
function `DirectProduct`. This function returns a group that is
isomorphic to the direct product of the given groups, along with two lists of
homomorphisms. The first list contains the embeddings of the original groups
into the direct product, and the second list contains the projections from the
direct product onto the original groups.
```
> C2 := CyclicGroup(2);;
> C4 := CyclicGroup(4);;
> G, a, b := DirectProduct(C2,C4);
> a;
[
    Mapping from: GrpPerm: C2 to GrpPerm: G,
    Mapping from: GrpPerm: C4 to GrpPerm: G
]
> b;
[
    Mapping from: GrpPerm: G to GrpPerm: C2,
    Mapping from: GrpPerm: G to GrpPerm: C4
]
> GroupName(G);
C2*C4
> #G;
8
```

Let us do some easy calculations with
some of these homomorphisms. For example, 
the first homomorphism of `a` 
is the group homomorphism 
from `C2` onto `G`. 
```
> f := a[1];
> f;
Mapping from: GrpPerm: C2 to GrpPerm: G
> Kernel(f);
Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 2
Order = 1
> Image(f);
Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 6
Order = 2
    (1, 2)
> Domain(f);
Symmetric group C2 acting on a set of cardinality 2
Order = 2
    (1, 2)    
```

We can also send a list of groups
to the function `DirectProduct`. Here is an example: 
```
> G := DirectProduct([C2,C4,C2,C2]);
> G;
Permutation group G acting on a set of cardinality 10
Order = 32 = 2^5
    (1, 2)
    (3, 4, 5, 6)
    (7, 8)
    (9, 10) 
> H := DirectProduct([C2,C2,C2,C4]);
> IsIsomorphic(G,H);
true Mapping from: GrpPerm: G to GrpPerm: H
Composition of Mapping from: GrpPerm: G to GrpPC and
Mapping from: GrpPC to GrpPC and
Mapping from: GrpPC to GrpPerm: H
```
