A typical exercise in elementary group theory 
asks to check that the group 
generated by certain two $2\times 2$ complex matrices
is isomorphic to the quaternion group. 

Let us check that the group
generated by 
$\begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{-1}&0 \\\ 0&-\sqrt{-1}
\end{pmatrix}$ and 
$\begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\\ -1&0
\end{pmatrix}$ 
is isomorphic to 
the quaternion group $Q_8$:
```
> K<i> := CyclotomicField(4);
> a := Matrix(2, [i,0,0,-i]);
> b := Matrix(2, [0,1,-1,0]);
> G := MatrixGroup<2,K|a,b>;
> GroupName(G);
Q8    
```
