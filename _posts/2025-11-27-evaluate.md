Given a polynomial `f`, does `f(1)` work instead of `Evaluate(f, 1)?`
No. For example, with the following code: 
```
Q<x> := PolynomialAlgebra(Rationals());
f := x^2+x+1;
f(1);
```
we get an error message: 
```
>> f(1);
    ^
Runtime error in '@': Bad argument types
Argument types given: RngIntElt, RngUPolElt[FldRat]
```
