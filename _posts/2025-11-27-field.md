##### Given a finite field , is there a way to get a generator of the group ?

Let `F` be your finite field. Then
```
M, f := MultiplicativeGroup(F);
```
returns the cyclic group `M`, isomorphic to the 
multiplicative group of `F`. 
Then simply compute `f(M.1)` for the
generator of the multiplicative group of the field. 
I think this might actually be the same as `F.1`.
