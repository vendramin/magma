The dihedral group of order six is the group generated by a rotation of angle
$2\pi/3$ and a reflection. 

Let us verify that 
the group generated by the matrices 
$\begin{pmatrix}
-1/2 & -\sqrt{3}/2\\\ \sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2
\end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\\0&-1
\end{pmatrix}$ is isomorphic to the
dihedral group of order six. 
```
Q<x> := PolynomialAlgebra(Rationals());
f := x^2 - 3;
K<z> := NumberField(f);
a := Matrix(2, [-1/2,-z/2,z/2,-1/2]);
b := Matrix(2, [1,0,0,-1]);
G := MatrixGroup<2,K|a,b>;
```
Which group is this? The command `GroupName(G);` returns `S3`. And we all know
that the dihedral group of order six is isomorphic to $\mathbb{S}_3$.
