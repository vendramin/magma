If not, what is the problem?

Magma doesn’t appear to like giving random elements of an infinite set (it even
complains when you ask for a random integer, for example, without giving it any
bounds). My suggestion would be to define (randomly) a complex number `x`
with real and imaginary parts both themselves specified by two sets of
(bounded) integers, and then using
```
elt<A | x, Random(Sym(3))>;
```
where `A` is the complex group algebra `Sym(3)` and `x` is your random complex
number.
