Is it possible to get a random element of $\mathbb{C}[G]$? If not, what is the problem?

Magma doesn’t appear to like giving random elements of an infinite set (it even
complains when you ask for a random integer, for example, without giving it any
bounds). Instead of using `ComplexField`, we will use the field
$\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Here is a concrete way to generate some sort of random
elements group algebras: 
```
G := Sym(3);
Q<i> := QuadraticField(-1);
A := GroupAlgebra(Q,G);
x := Random(-100,100);
y := Random(-100,100);
z := x+i*y;
```
In our case, `z` is `41*i + 34`. Now with
```
A!z*Random(G);
```
we get some sort of random element of our group algebra. In our case
we obtain `(41*i + 34)*(1, 2, 3)`.
