How can we quickly get all Sylow subgroups
of a given group?

To compute Sylow subgroups we have the function 
`SylowSubgroup`, but this function returns
only one Sylow subgroup. 
How can we quickly get them all?
```
> S3 := Sym(3);
> P := SylowSubgroup(S3,2);
> { P^x : x in S3 };
{
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (1, 3),
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (1, 2),
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (2, 3)
}    
```
Possibly faster: conjugate the Sylow subgroup computed 
by each element of a (right) transversal of the Sylow. 
Here is the code:  
```
> t := Transversal(S3,P);
> { P^x : x in t };
{
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (1, 3),
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (1, 2),
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (2, 3)
}    
```
We can also use the function `Conjugates`:
```
> Conjugates(S3,P);
{
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (2, 3),
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (1, 3),
    Permutation group acting on a set of cardinality 3
    Order = 2
        (1, 2)
}
```
